/*3.-You are to create two classes: one that reads and writes from a file and another that
reads and writes from a memory area. The interfaces used by the classes must have the
following prototypes: int read(char *buffer, unsigned int size) and int write(const char *
buffer, unsigned int size). Define an interface class from which the two classes may
inherit and be required to implement the read and write interfaces.(10 points)*/


class ReadWriteInterface {
	public:
		int read(char *buffer, unsigned int size){
		
		}
